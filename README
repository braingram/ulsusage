Parse usage logs (last 2000 jobs) for a universal laser systems laser cutter

The default log directory is:
"C:\\ProgramData\\ULSMVX"

if your system is different you may need to change the ddir value at the top
of parse_uls_usage.py

The script outputs a csv file with columns:
job index, job name, time (unix timestamp), duration (in seconds)

and also a 'raw' pickle file containing much more information.
